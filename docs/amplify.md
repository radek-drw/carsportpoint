# How `amplify.yml` workflow works?

- **applications** defines one or more applications that Amplify should handle
- **appRoot: frontend** tells Amplify that the app is in the `frontend/` folder
- **phases** define the steps in the build process
- **preBuild** is the step before the actual build
  ```yaml
  npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
  ```
- **npm ci** installs dependencies based on `package-lock.json`
- **--cache** .npm tells npm to use .npm folder as cache
- **--prefer-offline** makes npm try to use cached packages first to speed up the build
- **build** phase is where the actual app is compiled
- **npm run build** runs the build script from `package.json`
- **artifacts** tells Amplify what files to deploy after the build
- **baseDirectory: dist** means Amplify will look in the dist folder for the build output
- **files**: `"**/*"` means all files in the dist folder will be deployed
- **cache** specifies which files should be cached between builds to speed things up
- **.npm** folder (where npm stores downloaded packages) is cached, so Amplify doesn’t need to re-download everything every time
- **buildPath** serves the app from the root of the domain
